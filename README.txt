For my game I have implemented the processing.sound.* libaray for my sound
affects. Meaning in order to play my game with the full experience you
will need to import the sound library using the following instructions:

First, you need to have your Processing software open,

Second, go to Sketch->Import Library->Add Library. Then, a 
Contribution Manager window should pop up.

Third, in the filter input box, type in “Sound” and select install and wait 
for a few moments.

Sorry if this was the intended method of implimenting sound and I hope
it wont bring my grade down or cause to much trouble :)
